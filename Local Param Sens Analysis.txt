The magnitude of normalized steady-state sensitivities: how a 1% perturbation of each parameter affects Pc (GFP).
Theory:
  =======
  The steady-state sensitivity for the i-th element (state or reaction rate)
  x_i wrt to the parameter p_j is defined by:
 
  S_ij = [ Xss_i(p_j+delta_p_j) - Xss_i(p_j) ] / delta_p_j
 
  where Xss_i is the function returning the steady-state for this element
  (state or reaction rate) for the given parameters.
 
  The normalized sensitivity index is defined by
 
  Sn_ij = p_j/Xss_i(p_j) * S_ij
 
  The function Xss(p) is here used as objective function (Varma et al. 
  (1999) Parametric Sensitivity in Chemical Systems, Cambridge 
  University Press, New York).
